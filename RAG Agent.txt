What are the benefits of a RAG agent?
A RAG agent combines the power of a Large Language Model (LLM) with your application's private data. Instead of just using its general knowledge, the LLM first retrieves relevant, up-to-the-minute information from your database (projects, emails, files) and uses that specific context to generate its answers.

For Cadenzor, the key benefits would be:

Hyper-Contextual Answers: The agent would understand the specifics of each project, from contract terms and travel itineraries to the latest email exchanges. This is far more powerful than a generic AI assistant.
Increased Accuracy & Trust: By grounding responses in actual project data, the agent avoids making things up (hallucinating). It can even cite its sources (e.g., "According to the contract final_agreement.pdf, the fee is..."), building user trust.
Drastic Efficiency Gains: Users could ask complex questions in natural language instead of manually searching through emails, calendars, and project timelines. This saves a significant amount of time and reduces cognitive load.
Proactive Intelligence: The agent could go beyond answering questions to proactively identify risks, summarize new developments, and suggest next steps, acting as a true co-pilot for artist managers.
How could it be used in Cadenzor?
Your application already has a rich, structured dataset that would be perfect for a RAG agent. Based on your codebase, you're tracking projects, timeline items, calendar events, emails, and assets.

Here are some powerful use cases:

On-Demand Project Briefings:

User: "Give me a summary of the 'European Summer Tour' project."
RAG Agent: Retrieves the project status, upcoming timeline milestones, open tasks, and key linked emails. It then generates a summary: "The 'European Summer Tour' is active, with 12 confirmed dates. The next major milestone is the 'Paris Show' on July 15th. There are 3 overdue tasks, including 'Finalize travel for Berlin'. A contract redline for the 'Madrid Festival' arrived this morning and is awaiting review."
Answering Specific, Data-Driven Questions:

User: "What's the agreed-upon fee for the Tokyo show?"
RAG Agent: Scans assets and emails linked to the 'Tokyo Show' timeline item. It responds: "The performance fee is $25,000, as stated in the executed contract tokyo_agreement_signed.pdf linked to the event."
Cross-Referencing Information:

User: "When is the promo interview for the new single, and does it clash with any travel?"
RAG Agent: Finds the 'PROMO_SLOT' on the timeline and cross-references it with 'TRAVEL_SEGMENT' items. It could answer: "The promo interview is scheduled for July 10th at 2 PM London time. There is a potential conflict, as your flight to Berlin departs at 4 PM the same day, leaving a tight window."
Drafting Communications:

User: "Draft an email to the promoter for the Paris show asking for the day sheet and confirming our technical rider is the latest version."
RAG Agent: Retrieves the promoter's contact info from linked emails and finds the latest technical rider in the project's assets. It then generates a draft email with the correct context and attachments.
How much development would it be?
Setting up a robust RAG agent involves several stages. Hereâ€™s a high-level breakdown of the development effort:

1. Data Preparation & Embedding (Medium Effort)
This is the foundation. You need to transform your application's data into a format that the RAG system can search.

Identify Data Sources: You've already got these: projects, timeline_entries, project_tasks, emails, and assets (especially text-based ones like contracts and documents).
Chunking: Break down large documents (like emails or contracts) into smaller, meaningful paragraphs or "chunks." Each chunk will become a searchable item.
Embedding: Use an embedding model (like text-embedding-3-small from OpenAI or an open-source alternative) to convert each chunk of text into a vector (a list of numbers). This vector represents the semantic meaning of the text.
Vector Store: Store these vectors and their corresponding text chunks in a specialized vector database like Pinecone, Weaviate, or Supabase's own pgvector extension.
Implementation: You'd need to create background jobs or serverless functions that trigger whenever data is created or updated. For example, when a new email is linked to a project or a new contract is uploaded, a job would chunk, embed, and store it in the vector database.

2. Retrieval API (Low-to-Medium Effort)
You need an API endpoint that takes a user's query, embeds it, and searches the vector database for the most relevant chunks of text.

Query Endpoint: Create a new API route, e.g., /api/agent/query.
Vector Search: This endpoint takes the user's question, converts it into a vector using the same embedding model, and queries the vector store to find the "top-k" (e.g., top 5) most similar vectors.
Context Assembly: The endpoint retrieves the original text chunks corresponding to these vectors and assembles them into a context string to be passed to the LLM.
3. Generation & Streaming (Medium Effort)
This is where the "magic" happens. You send the user's query and the retrieved context to an LLM.

LLM Integration: Use a provider like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google Gemini. You'll create a prompt that includes the retrieved context and the original user question, instructing the model to answer based only on the provided information.
Streaming Responses: For a good user experience, you should stream the LLM's response back to the client word-by-word, rather than waiting for the full answer. This requires using a streaming-capable API response format (like ReadableStream).
UI Component: You'll need to build a chat interface on the frontend that can send queries and render the streamed response.
4. Adding "Tools" for Live Data (High Effort - Advanced)
For maximum power, you can give the agent "tools" to query your production database directly for real-time, structured data that isn't suitable for vector search (e.g., event start times, task statuses).

Tool Definition: Define functions the agent can call, like get_timeline_events(project_id, date_range) or get_open_tasks(project_id).
Agentic Logic: Use an LLM that supports "function calling" or "tool use." The LLM decides which tool to call based on the user's query, you execute the function, and then feed the result back to the LLM to generate the final answer. This is more complex but allows for highly accurate, real-time responses.
Overall Estimate:

MVP (Vector search on one data source, e.g., emails): 2-3 weeks. This is achievable for a single engineer and would already provide significant value.
Robust Implementation (Multiple data sources, streaming, basic UI): 4-6 weeks.
Advanced Agent (With tools/function calling, sophisticated UI, proactive alerts): 2-3 months+, likely involving ongoing iteration.
Frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex can significantly accelerate this process by providing pre-built components for chunking, retrieval, and agent logic, and I would highly recommend using one.
