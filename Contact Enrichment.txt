What you’re building

When a new lead/promo email arrives (promoter, venue, radio, journalist), the system:

extracts who/where/when,

runs an Enrichment job (internal history + public context),

produces two transparent scores: Reliability and Brand Fit,

recommends an action band: Accept / Caution / Decline with conditions,

saves the snapshot with sources so Oran can trust it (and override).

This runs automatically when labels indicate the sender is a potential partner (e.g., Booking/Promo), and can be re-run on demand.

Scoring model (explainable, versioned)
A) Reliability score (0–100)

Purpose: “Will they deliver professionally and pay on time?”

Subscores & defaults (tune per artist/project):

On-time payment (0–100, weight 30%)
Internal metric: average days to settle vs contract terms; chargebacks; deposit compliance.

Response speed (0–100, weight 20%)
Median reply time over last N threads vs agreed SLA.

Logistics quality (0–100, weight 30%)
Past incident flags: late itineraries/riders, missing backline, last-minute changes; completion rate of advance checklists.

Past issues (0–100, weight −20% as a penalty)
Severity-weighted deductions for no-shows, non-payment, safety complaints.

Outputs: Reliability 0–100 + band (High ≥80, Medium 60–79, Low <60) + 2–3 bullet “why” facts.

B) Brand Fit score (0–100)

Purpose: “Does this outlet/venue align with Barry/SHEE’s artistic lane and strategy?”

Subscores & defaults:

Genre/scene adjacency (0–100, weight 25%)
Embedding similarity between artist brand vector and venue/event/radio format text.

Line-up/recent guests quality (0–100, weight 20%)
Recent headliners/guests from public listings; overlap with your “admired artists” list.

Reputation pulse (0–100, weight 15%)
Recent news/posts; penalties for controversies; positive press uplift.

Audience/format match (0–100, weight 15%)
Station format tier (e.g., BBC R1 Tier-1) or venue capacity/type vs target.

Routing fit (0–100, weight 15%)
Time/geo fit with tour timeline; travel/timezone feasibility.

Promo leverage (0–100, weight 10%)
Social footprint proxies (follower bucket, posting cadence, previous campaign performance with this org).

Outputs: Brand Fit 0–100 + band (Great ≥80, Good 60–79, Weak <60) + 2–3 bullet “why” facts.

C) Decision band (policy)

Accept: Reliability High & Brand Fit Good/Great.

Caution: Borderline reliability or fit; suggest conditions (e.g., 50% deposit, earlier soundcheck, tighter deliverables).

Decline: Low reliability or fit; offer a polite decline draft.

All scores are versioned. Store the rubric version so changes don’t rewrite history.

Signals & sources (safe + realistic)

Internal (authoritative):

Settlements & payment dates; checklist completion; response-time stats; incident flags; past approvals/declines; artist brand profile text.

External (public, ToS-safe options first):

Venue/Org basics: Google Places/Maps Details; venue website crawl (Playwright/Browserless).

Event history: Resident Advisor / Bandsintown / Songkick (public pages if API access limited).

Radio/press: station/site “About” pages, recent guest lists, playlist formats.

News pulse: Bing News / NewsAPI / GDELT headlines for the last 12 months.

Social footprint: public counts and cadence (avoid intrusive scraping).

Note on LinkedIn: automated scraping commonly violates ToS. Prefer official APIs/permissions or rely on website mastheads and public bios. Keep it compliant.

AI usage:

Use LLM for synthesis and embedding similarity, not for core facts. Cite sources in the snapshot.

Trigger → Pipeline (what happens, step by step)

Trigger: Email labeled Booking/Promo (and optionally city/venue).

Entity extraction: People/org names, role, domain, venue, city, proposed dates, budget terms.

Internal look-up: Past deals with this contact/org; payment & logistics metrics; incident log.

External enrichment: Venue/org basics; recent lineups/guests; station format; news pulse; social proxies; routing feasibility vs your timeline.

Scoring: Compute Reliability & Brand Fit subscores → weighted totals → decision band.

Snapshot: Store enrichment_snapshot with inputs, outputs, and citations + rubric version.

Surface: Create a Lead Card in the Inbox drawer & in the relevant Project with: score badges, subscores, “why”, suggested conditions, one-click actions (Accept with conditions / Request info / Decline).

Cache: Redis-cache snapshot for 30 days; re-run only on major updates (date change, new info, or manual refresh).

Data model (additions—no code)

org_profiles: id, name, domain, kind (venue/radio/press/brand), capacity, location, links, metadata.

contact_profiles: id, person_name, email, role, org_id, phones, socials, territory.

artist_brand_profiles: artist_id, brand_text, “admired artists” list, banned contexts, capacity targets, tier mapping.

reliability_rollups: org_id/contact_id, on_time_payment %, avg response hrs, logistics score, incidents json, updated_at.

enrichment_runs: id, ref (email_id/thread_id), org_id/contact_id, project_id, rubric_version, inputs json, outputs json, citations json, created_at.

brand_fit_vectors: id, entity_type (org/venue/station), vector, last_refreshed.

artist_brand_vectors: artist_id, vector, last_refreshed.

score_components (optional): run_id, component_key, value, weight, rationale.

UI placements (so it’s actually useful)

Inbox drawer (for a lead):
Score badges Reliability/Brand Fit, decision band, 3-bullet “why”, conditions, and one-click actions:

Accept (with conditions) → opens draft reply + checklist seeds.

Ask follow-ups → auto-draft clarifying questions (budget, tech, times).

Decline → polite draft with optional reason.

Project Hub → People & Leads:
Filterable grid by city/venue/station, score bands, and date; show trend (score over time).

Today / Digest:
“New leads” widget with top 3 by (Brand Fit × Reliability × routing fit) and direct Approve/Decline links.

Conditions library (for “Caution” band)

Payment: “50% deposit on booking; balance T-7”

Promo: “Confirm promo asset deadlines and outlet deliverables by T-14”

Production: “Provide backline spec and soundcheck window ≥90 min”

Routing: “Shift set by +30 min to allow post-flight buffer”

These are selectable toggles that insert into the draft reply & internal checklist.

“City buzz” & calendar conflict signal (lightweight)

When a date is proposed for City X:

Pull the top 3 competing events that night (public calendars/listings).

Show a Crowd Competition subscore (0–100) with links (“Two major festivals nearby”).

Add a Routing Feasibility tag (“OK with 4h buffer” / “Tight: only 1h”).

Privacy, ethics, and guardrails

Store only business-relevant info (no health/religion/politics).

Keep snapshots with citations; Oran can see the source of every claim.

Redact PII (bank/passport) before LLM.

Respect site ToS; prefer official APIs or plainly public pages.

Performance & cost controls

Cache all external lookups for 30 days.

Reuse embeddings (pgvector) for artist and org.

Use small LLM for extraction; reserve larger model for the final 3-bullet rationale only when scores are close to threshold.

MVP slice (2 sprints, high impact)

Reliability (internal-only): on-time payments, response speed, logistics incidents → score + band.

Brand Fit (light): genre/scene similarity (embedding vs org/venue/station description) + tier mapping (BBC R1=Tier-1, etc.).

Lead Card UI in Inbox drawer + Project Leads tab, with decision band and conditions toggles.

Snapshot & cache storage with one-click actions (Accept/Ask/Decline → drafts only).
Acceptance: Oran sees a new lead → gets a clear score with “why”, and can approve a conditioned acceptance in <60 seconds.

Phase 2 (polish)

External event history & “city buzz” conflict signal.

News pulse & reputation flags.

Org-level rollups and per-territory reliability.

Learning loop: adjust weights from Oran’s Accept/Decline outcomes.

Next best step actions (today → build order)

Product config

Write a Brand Rubric v1 (weights above) per artist; store in artist_brand_profiles + rubric_version=1.

Seed Tier mapping for radio/stations and venue capacity targets.

Data plumbing
3) Create org_profiles / contact_profiles / reliability_rollups / enrichment_runs tables.
4) Add artist_brand_vectors / brand_fit_vectors (pgvector ready).

Worker jobs
5) On Booking/Promo label → queue enrichment_run (internal rollups first, then external light).
6) Compute scores + save snapshot + cache.

UI
7) Add Lead Card (Inbox drawer + Project Leads tab) with score badges, bullet “why”, and quick actions.
8) Add Conditions selector that injects text into draft reply and seeds a checklist.

Governance
9) Log every enrichment run with sources and keep a toggle to mask external data if needed.
10) Add a “Re-score” button and a “mark as incorrect” feedback that adjusts future weights (a tiny learning loop).

Why this helps Oran immediately

He stops guessing. Every new lead comes with scores, rationale, and a safe next step.

It scales judgment across dozens of emails without drowning him.

It’s explainable and editable: change weights, re-score, keep receipts (citations).

It sets the stage for smarter playbooks (accept with conditions, decline politely, or ask the right 3 questions).

If you want, I can turn the scoring rubric and the conditions library into a one-page “Business Rules” sheet (plain English) that you can paste into your admin settings and treat as versioned policy.
